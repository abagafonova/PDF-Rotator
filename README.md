## Usage

1. **Click "Browse PDF…"** and select your PDF file
2. **Choose rotation direction:**
   - `↻ 90° clockwise` — use this if text is rotated to the left (←)
   - `↺ 90° counter-clockwise` — use this if text is rotated to the right (→)
   - `↻↻ 180°` — use this to flip upside-down pages
3. **Click "Rotate & Save"**
4. A new file named `original_name_rotated.pdf` is saved in the **same folder** as your original

---

## How to choose the right rotation

| Your PDF looks like... | Choose |
|---|---|
| Text is on its side, readable from the right | ↻ 90° clockwise |
| Text is on its side, readable from the left | ↺ 90° counter-clockwise |
| Text is upside down | ↻↻ 180° |

**Tip:** If you are not sure, try 90° clockwise first. If the result is wrong, undo by rotating the output file 90° counter-clockwise (or just use the original again).

## Use case: OCR of scanned book photos

This tool is especially useful when you have PDFs made from photos of books taken sideways to speed up scanning. Rotating the PDF first produces a properly-oriented file that OCR tools can process more accurately.

Workflow:
1. Rotate your PDF with PDF Rotator → `book_rotated.pdf`
2. Load `book_rotated.pdf` into your OCR tool
3. Get accurate text extraction
